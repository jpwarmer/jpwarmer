### Hi there. ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github repositories. 

Unfortunately, you won't find a lot of code here. I always worked for big companies and none allows me to put the code I made here. In fact, currently, I'm using a Bitbucket private repository. What you may find here are my pet projects, the small ones that we all use to learn new technologies or job interviews, or just simply to get fun developing something.

So, in the meantime, let me tell you about me now:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Upwork, the world's largest work marketplace connecting millions of businesses with independent talent around the globe.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Node, Vue, Nuxt, Typescript. Basically, modern Javascript.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? [By mail](mailto:jpwarmer@gmail.com)  or through my [LinkedIn profile page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-pablo-warmerdam-463a214/) <- Here you will find a lot more information.

Anyway, I hope any of this will help you in any way. Cheers!
